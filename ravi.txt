To see if you already have Git installed, open up your terminal application.

If you're on a Mac, look for a command prompt application called "Terminal".
If you're on a Windows machine, open the windows command prompt or "Git Bash".
Once you've opened your terminal application, type git version. The output will either tell you which version of Git is installed, or it will alert you that git is an unknown command. If it's an unknown command, read further and find out how to install Git.
